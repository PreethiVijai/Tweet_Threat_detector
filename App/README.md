# Threat-Detector

Note: This app requires python 3

If you'd like, you can start a python virtual environment by typing
`python -m venv ENV`. You then activate this environment by typing
`. ENV/bin/activate`. This will keep the below dependencies from
being installed to your python installation globally.

To install the app dependencies, type `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the test app, run `python app.py`

You can then access the test app by going to `<server-url>:8080/`
